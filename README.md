# Discord bot that bans genshin players

 Are you tired of genshin impact players?
 Invite this bot to your server to ban anyone who plays genshin impact.
 
 
 # INVITE LINK: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=965018116373512236&permissions=8&scope=bot
 
 
 # Remember that in a discord server there is a role list and a role can only ban or kick a member of lower status so it is advised to move the E.M.M.I role just below the server admins on the role list
 
 THANKS TO https://github.com/M-et/LOL-Banner.js/blob/main/bot.js FOR BIG PARTS OF THE CODE, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW HIM TOO
