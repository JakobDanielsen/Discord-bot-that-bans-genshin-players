# Discord bot that bans genshin players

 Are you tired of genshin impact players?
 Invite this bot to your server to ban anyone who plays genshin impact.
 
 
 # INVITE LINK: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=965018116373512236&permissions=8&scope=bot
 
 
 # IMPORTANT!!! Remember that in a discord server there is a role list and a role can only ban or kick a member of lower status so _you need to move the E.M.M.I role just below the server admins_ on the role list or it _will not work_.
